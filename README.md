# Train-Scheduler
This app uses Firebase to update the schedules for trains.
This train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival data. The data is manipulated using Moment.js. This app provides up-to-date information about various trains on website upload, refresh, and every minute from upload. It displays arrival times and how many minutes remain until trains arrive at their station, relative to the current time.

When adding trains, users submit the following:
Train Name
Destination
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
